# Evading the Predator: Using Genetic Algorithm to Optimize Shoaling Fish Survival

## Description

This project explores the optimization of survival strategies in mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) against a predator using a novel agent-based model (ABM). The model incorporates attraction and repulsion behaviors based on the nearest neighbor, which has proven effective in smaller shoals. The primary aim is to use a genetic algorithm to evolve the behavioral parameters of the fish, enhancing their survival rate in larger shoals. The approach is benchmarked against a random search algorithm for comparative analysis.
